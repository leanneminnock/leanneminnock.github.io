    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Hi, I'm Leanne. I am an aspiring full stack developer (and avid crocheter). <br>
      I have taken an opportunity in the last year to follow my interest in software development and hone my full stack
      skills.
      After many eureka moments and just a few exesential crises, I am finally at a stage where I can say that I am a
      developer. <br>
      So, let me tell you a little about my journey over the last year:

            <h6><strong>Features</strong></h6>
            This is a practice app using Angular.
            The aim of this project was to practice inter-component communication and routing, and also practice general
            familiarity with TypeScript.
            <hr class="my-4">
            <h6><strong>Challenges</strong></h6>
            TypeScript as a language has a learning curve when coming from a background in a highly structured language
            such as C#.
            This was a challenge at first and took practice to get the hang of, though nothing campared to the
            challenges of pure JavaScript.
            Routing was also a difficult concept when introduced, it took this and a few other projects to gain a clear
            understanding of when and how to use it.

            <p class="card-text">
            <h6><strong>Features</strong></h6>
            A frontend app to practice angular tooling using a mock json response. <br>
            The main aim of this app was to refine understanding of taking in data from a source to manupulate and display it to users.
            <hr class="my-4">
            <h6><strong>Challenges</strong></h6>
            A big learning in this app was applying a state and using routing to maintain state integrity between components. For example, if a Tweet is liked or not when looking at a full stream and the individual Tweet.

            <h5 class="card-title">Pokedex</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
            <h6><strong>Features</strong></h6>
            This app is a frontend practice app, using an external API.
            The focus was to practice routing, using Bootstrap and integrating with the Pokemon API using their
            documentation as a guide.
            <hr class="my-4">
            <h6><strong>Challenges</strong></h6>
            Working with an external API was tricky at first, reading the docs was challenging until I figured out how
            the API worked.
            I ran into an obsatcle when I tried to integrate a search option into the site.
            After a lot of trial and error I deduced that the API didn't offer search capabilities.
            Now when looking into using an API I'm conscious of the possible limitations.

            <h5 class="card-title">Dutch Treat</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
            <h6><strong>Features</strong></h6>
            This is a full stack application from database to site created as part of a Pluralsight course using a C#
            Dotnet Core back end and Angular front end. <br>
            An API was created to populate and query an SQL database using Entity Framework Core.
            The combination of razor pages and Angular was used to create a store front including a checkout page.
            <hr class="my-4">
            <h6><strong>Challenges</strong></h6>
            There were many obstacles throughout this project, the most frustrating being the library versions in the
            course were out of date.
            This fundamentaly broke the application on numerous occasions and I had to do a lot of research to fix the
            breaking changes between versions.
            Part of the course taught about using auth tokens for user login varification. This I found tricky and still
            do as security
            is complex and has a high learning curve.
